### Project Success and Failures<a id="sec-1-2-4" name="sec-1-2-4"></a>

1.  Four Bases for Successful Projects

    1.  Technology scale: High tech to low tech
    
    2.  Novelty scale: Derivative to Novel
    
    3.  Pace scale: Regular to Blitz
    
    4.  Complexity Scale: Assembly to Array

2.  Measuring Success

    1.  On time?
    
    2.  Scope?
    
    3.  Cost?

### Supplements<a id="sec-1-2-5" name="sec-1-2-5"></a>

1.  Boyhood

    1.  Very well thought off
    
    2.  Had the leisure of time
    
    3.  Made with passion
    
    4.  Lesser variables
    
    5.  Artisitic liberty can cover a lot of flaws

2.  BA Terminal 5

    1.  Too many variables
    
    2.  Not enough testing
    
    3.  Did not manage stakeholder's expectations well enough
    
    4.  Did not take into account all the stakeholders such as parking attendent.
    
    5.  Not enough training

### Project Lifecycle<a id="sec-1-2-6" name="sec-1-2-6"></a>

1.  Initiation

2.  Planning

3.  Execution

4.  Close-out

## Planning<a id="sec-1-3" name="sec-1-3"></a>

### Why Plan?<a id="sec-1-3-1" name="sec-1-3-1"></a>

1.  Drucker's Effective Execution: What is a plan

    1.  Plan is a set of intentions but not commitments
    
    2.  It is not set in stone
    
    3.  Evolves as the project evolves
    
    4.  Need a system to check results against expectations
    
    5.  Becomes the basis for executive time management

2.  Components of a plan

    1.  Scope
    
    2.  Tasks, Dependencies, Schedule
    
    3.  Resource planning
    
    4.  Clarify tradeoffs and decision making principles
    
    5.  Risk management plan

### Detailed Scoping<a id="sec-1-3-2" name="sec-1-3-2"></a>

1.  Activity: Work Breakdown Structure

    1.  Brainstorm using whiteboards, sticky notes etc.
    
    2.  Can use tools like WBSPro
    
    3.  Detail down to the level where each task is equal to 5%-10% of the total duration of a single resource

### Identifying dependencies<a id="sec-1-3-3" name="sec-1-3-3"></a>

1.  Logical flow is identified

2.  Duration can be imagined

3.  Dependency diagrams

    1.  Matrix
    
    2.  Table
    
    3.  Network Diagram
    
        1.  No hanging tasks

4.  Types of dependencies - Precedence relationships

    1.  Start to finish
    
    2.  Finish to finish
    
    3.  Start to Start
    
    4.  Finish to start

### Completion date and critical path<a id="sec-1-3-4" name="sec-1-3-4"></a>

1.  Estimation Challenges

    1.  Parkinson's law
    
        A person will take the entire duration allotted to them for a task and not less.
    
    2.  Student's syndrome
    
        Procrastination will rule the day. A task allotted 4 weeks maybe completed in the last 4 days because of procrastination.
    
    3.  Overconfidence
    
    4.  Biases
    
        1.  Anchoring and Confirmation

2.  Critical Path

    1.  Longest path through the network diagram
    
    2.  Project duration is defined by this
    
    3.  Any delay along the critical path will result in project delay
    
    4.  Developed by engineers at DuPont in 1950

### How do we schedule?<a id="sec-1-3-5" name="sec-1-3-5"></a>

1.  As soon as possible - constrained by time, incurring earlier cost

2.  As late as possible - constrained by cost, incurring time penalties possibly

    Looking at historical estimates and expectations, we estimate anchored from these positions

### Reducing Schedule<a id="sec-1-3-6" name="sec-1-3-6"></a>

1.  Shorten critical path - Project crashing

    1.  Select the least expensive to crash
    
    2.  New critical paths may emerge.
    
    3.  Project crashing is cyclical
    
    4.  We might introduce lesser slack
    
    5.  We might introduce more risk

2.  Scope Reduction

    1.  Eliminate unnecessary task
    
    2.  Reduce functionality
    
    3.  Cut corners
    
    4.  Outsource

### Reflecting on Common Mistakes<a id="sec-1-3-7" name="sec-1-3-7"></a>

1.  Common Mistakes

    1.  No WBS
    
        1.  Incorrect Scope
        2.  No Responsibility assigned
        3.  Incorrect project duration, critical path and cost estimates
    
    2.  Task durations specified in terms of work and not in terms of resource
    
        1.  Underestimated task duration
        2.  Incorrect crucial path
    
    3.  No Network Diagram
    
    4.  Precedence Relationships mistakes
    
        1.  Tasks without pre and succ
        
        2.  Using fixed dates
        
        3.  Tasks should have the correct dependencies. Prone to error
        
        4.  Dependencies between summary and not tasks

2.  Checklist to avoid mistakes

    1.  WBS
    
        1.  Available?
        2.  Complete?
        3.  Discusses upon?
        4.  Agreed upon?
    
    2.  Network Diagram
    
        1.  Has a start node and an end node
        2.  All activities with predecessors and/or successors
    
    3.  Milestone
    
        1.  One milestone at the start and one project completion milestone
        2.  Intermediate milestones? Each one has a critical path?
    
    4.  Gantt-chart
    
        1.  No missing dependencies between activities in correct sequence?
        2.  No summary task links?
        3.  Tasks with excessive durations - needs to be broken down
        4.  Check dependencies(overlaps, time lags)
        5.  Check critical path: from project start to finish

3.  Planning Wrap Up

    1.  Project planning crucial for project success
    2.  It's a guide and not a schedule
    3.  Follow project planning cycle
    4.  Make sure that the goal is clear
    5.  Ensure project scope is complete
    6.  Estimate activity duration overcoming challenges
    7.  Decides who owns each activity
    8.  Know which are critical activities
    9.  Prevent conflict between activities
    10. Project crashing/fast tracking are your tools to be used

    1.  For some of the above we might have a contingency plan and for some we should have a mitigation plan. For some we might have a backup plan ready.
    
    2.  Risk score = Impact Score \* Likelihood Score

3.  A more realistic timeline

    1.  Get min and max for a task
    
    2.  Tornado Digram
    
        1.  Concentrate on the tasks at the top of Tornado diagram
    
    3.  Elicit different opinion
    
    4.  Start thinking of project completion date as a range and not a fixed date
    
    5.  Start assigning probability distribution diagram with each point of estimated range
    
    6.  Using tools, one can come up with various charts which will start displaying our confidence level of a task completion within a time period
    
    7.  Criticality Indices associated with each task will emerge which will tell us the probability of a task to remain on critcal path. With this knowledge, one can concentrate on tasks with high criticality index.

4.  Cost Risk Analysis

    1.  Contigency for entire project and not for individual tasks

1.  Execution

    1.  Monitor
    
        1.  Physical or virtual?
        
        2.  Frequency
        
        3.  PMO?
        
        4.  Monitor what?
    
    2.  Report Collection
    
        1.  Frequency
        
        2.  By Who?
        
        3.  To Who?
    
    3.  Correct and Control
    
        1.  What decisions? What actions?
        
        2.  Who is in charge of execution
        
        3.  How will the outcomes communicated?
